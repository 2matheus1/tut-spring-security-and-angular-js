= OAuth2 Logout

Options:

* External authserver. You don't want to log out. You do want approval for all grants.

* Log out from authserver as well as UI app in client. Works with some careful CRSF and CORS configuration but thee are some limitations when using more than one UI app.

* Proxy authserver through same gateway as UI. Doesn't work because there is no session storage for the authserver (so actually works but only with a shared session, which defeats the object).

* Poll authserver from UI apps, and logout when no remote authentication can be obtained.
